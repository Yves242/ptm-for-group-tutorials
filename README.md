## About

This repository is managed and established by Computer Science peer tutors, committed to supporting fellow computer science students. The primary objective is to create a repository serving as a comprehensive reference for you. It is designed to be a valuable container for the code samples discussed during our tutoring sessions, providing a reliable resource to reinforce your understanding of various topics even when you're outside the peer tutoring environment.

## Code Samples

Explore the `codes` directory to find examples related to various concepts and programming languages. This directory contains the files that were used during our tutoring sessions, serving as a valuable reference for you. Feel free to review and study these materials to reinforce your understanding of the topics covered in our sessions.

## Challenges

Find additional practice and challenges in the `challenges` folder. These exercises are curated to further enhance your skills and provide opportunities for hands-on application of the concepts we discussed during our sessions. Feel free to explore and tackle these assignments at your own pace.
